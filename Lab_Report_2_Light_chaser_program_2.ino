	/* Arduino Light Chaser Program 2
	The goal of this program is to make four LEDs light up one at a time in a repeating sequence going forwards and backwards.
	Ex: Blue->Green->Red->Yellow->Red->Green->Blue
	The main theme of this program is Digital Output and DigitalWrite. We're controlling multiple LEDs using digital pins to create an LED sequence
